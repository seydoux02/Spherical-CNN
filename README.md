## Introduction

Equivariant neural networks offer a powerful way to handle data that exhibits symmetry. This repository provides tools and examples for working with such networks, specifically on spherical domains. The focus on the sphere \( S^2 \) allows for applications in various fields, including computer vision, robotics, and physics.

## Features

- Interactive tools for exploring equivariant neural networks.
- Focus on the mathematical foundations of homogeneous spaces.
- Integration with PyTorch for deep learning applications.
- Examples demonstrating the use of spherical CNNs.
- Comprehensive documentation to guide users.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seydoux02/Spherical-CNN.git
cd Spherical-CNN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed. 

## Usage

Once installed, you can start exploring the functionalities of Spherical-CNN. Here‚Äôs a basic example of how to use the library:

```python
import torch
from spherical_cnn import SphericalCNN

# Create a spherical CNN instance
model = SphericalCNN()

# Example input
input_data = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)  # Batch size of 1, 3 channels, 64x64 resolution

# Forward pass
output = model(input_data)
print(output.shape)
```

For more detailed usage, check the [examples](#examples) section below.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Spherical CNN

Here‚Äôs a simple example demonstrating how to create and use a spherical CNN.

```python
import torch
from spherical_cnn import SphericalCNN

# Initialize the model
model = SphericalCNN()

# Generate random input
input_data = torch.randn(1, 3, 128, 128)

# Perform a forward pass
output = model(input_data)

# Print output shape
print("Output shape:", output.shape)
```

### Example 2: Training a Model

To train a model on your dataset, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset.
2. Create a data loader.
3. Define a loss function and optimizer.
4. Train the model.

Here‚Äôs a simplified code snippet:

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from spherical_cnn import SphericalCNN

# Load your dataset
train_loader = DataLoader(your_dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)

# Initialize the model, loss, and optimizer
model = SphericalCNN()
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for data, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(data)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```
